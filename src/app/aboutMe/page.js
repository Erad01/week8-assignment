            <p>Hi! I am Dare, a football lover and aspiring software developer based in the Glasgow, Scotland</p><br></br>
            <p>I am currently learning how to bring ideas to life with JavaScript, React, and full-stack web development.</p><br></br>
            <br></br>
            <p>When I am not coding, you will probably find me catching up on Premier League matches, writing about the game, or exploring new tech projects. Football and creativity keep me inspired, and I love finding ways to mix both worlds.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Stick around to read my takes on the beautiful game. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
