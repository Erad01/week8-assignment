REQUIREMENTS

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

I Created a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.

I Created a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.

I added a redirect when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page.

I Created a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.

I was able to allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. /posts/:postid).

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I was not able to apply the knowledge from class to do the sorting of the posts in ascending and descending oeder.

I did not create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I really did understand the sorting in the class demo but while applying the priciples in the assignment it did not work the way i planned on using it. Am sure when I have time I will be able to understand better why it did not work and how to do it well.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

A feedback on the best way to sort the post items will be helpful.

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

I did revision of our classes and was able to apply the knowledge in doing the assignment. Also watcheda few videos on youtube for guide too.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
The sorting of my post items was a big bug that I did not envisage.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

I would say the fact that was able to do this from start to finish was a big plus as in the previous week I could not finalise the assignment. while doing the assignment this week I was very calm about it without thinking too much about the whole picture. I took it step by step until i was able to come up with my output.

I spoke with our Tutor a few times for input especially when I was trying to decide how to match the pictures dynamically in my post. We discussed and I decided I would use them remotely instead of locally. For me, that was faster codewise compare to the other option where i'd have to iterate through them to match them. It was a trade-off between having full control of the app and completing the work fasrer. I picked the faster option because I wanted to make sure I did better than the last week.
